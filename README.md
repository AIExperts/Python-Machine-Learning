# Python Machine Learning

## Description

A set of machine learing algorithms implemented in Python 3.5. Programs can one of three implementations:

1. Algorithm is implemented from scratch in Python *
2. Algorithm is implemented using Scikit Learn * *
3. Algorithm is implemented both ways * * *

The included programs are:

1. Linear Regression * * *
2. Logistic Regression for Classification * * *
3. Logistic Regression for Classification with PCA * * *
4. Naive Bayes Classification * * *
5. Support Vector Machine Classification * *
6. Neural Network Classification * *
7. Neural Network Regression * *
8. K-Means Clustering * * *
9. K-Nearest-Neighbor * * * 
10. Mean-Shift Clustering * * *
11. K-Mediods Clustering *
12. DBSCAN Clustering * * * 
13. Decision Tree Regression * * * 
14. Decision Tree Classification * * *

## Helpers
In addition the the main algorithm files, we have the following set of helper functions in the "ml_helpers.py" file:

1. Train and Test data splitting
2. Random shuffling of data
3. Compute Euclidean Distance
4. Compute Mean and Variance of features
5. Normalize data
6. Divide dataset based on feature threshold
7. Compute entropy
8. Compute Mean Squared Error
9. Sigmoid function
10. Derivative of the sigmoid function
11. Compute the covariance matrix
12. Perform PCA dimensionality reduction
13. Gaussian function 1D
14. Gaussian function 2D
