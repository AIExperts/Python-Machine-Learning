# Python Machine Learning

## Description

A set of machine learing algorithms implemented in Python 3.5. Programs can one of three implementations:

1. Algorithm is implemented from scratch in Python *
2. Algorithm is implemented using Scikit Learn * *
3. Algorithm is implemented both ways * * *

The included programs are:
